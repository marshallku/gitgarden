# Git Garden ðŸŒ±

Git Garden is a creative and engaging visualization tool that transforms your GitHub activity into a beautiful garden. Each element in your gardenâ€”whether it's a tree, flower, or decorationâ€”represents different aspects of your contributions on GitHub. Watch your garden grow as you commit to repositories, give stars, and engage with the open-source community. Git Garden also reflects your most used programming language through visual cues in the environment, making your coding journey more interactive and fun!

## Features

- **Interactive Garden**: Your GitHub activity is represented by a dynamic garden where trees, flowers, and other elements grow and change.
- **Gamification**: Earn trees by giving stars to repositories, and grow flowers by committing to your projects.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Your garden evolves in real-time based on your GitHub activity.
- **Language Visualization (planned)**: The most used programming language is visually reflected in the garden through color schemes, decorations, and special effects.
- **Customizable Themes (planned)**: Different themes are available based on the programming languages you use the most.

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Integration**: Git Garden connects to your GitHub account to track your contributions, repositories, stars, and more.
2. **Visualization**: Based on your activities, the garden elements grow and change. Each element (like a tree or flower) represents a different kind of activity.
3. **Language Representation (planned)**: The most used programming language in your repositories influences the appearance of your gardenâ€”whether through colors, shapes, or seasonal themes.

### Example

- **Commit More, Grow More**: Every time you commit to a project, a new flower blooms in your garden.
- **Star Repositories, Grow Trees**: Give stars to other repositories, and watch trees sprout up in your garden.
- **Language Influence (planned)**: If JavaScript is your most used language, the garden might show yellow flowers, while Python could bring a green theme.
